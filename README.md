# 🍽️ Food Spoilage Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Food Spoilage Detection System** is an AI-powered solution designed to **analyze food quality and detect spoilage** in real-time. By leveraging **Machine Learning and IoT sensors**, the system can accurately assess the freshness of food, reducing food waste and ensuring consumer safety.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **🧪 Spoilage Detection** – Uses AI models to analyze food quality based on color, texture, and odor data.
- **📊 Quality Analysis Dashboard** – Provides real-time reports on food conditions.
- **🌡️ Sensor Integration** – Works with IoT sensors to track temperature, humidity, and gas emissions.
- **📷 Image-Based Detection** – Uses computer vision to detect spoilage from food images.
- **🔔 Alerts & Notifications** – Sends warnings when food is at risk of spoilage.
- **📦 Smart Inventory Management** – Helps businesses manage stock based on food freshness.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js / Next.js (for dashboard UI)
- **Backend:** Python (Flask / FastAPI)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow / PyTorch (for AI-based spoilage detection)
- **IoT Sensors:** MQ Gas Sensors, Temperature & Humidity Sensors
- **Cloud Storage:** AWS S3 / Firebase
- **Notification System:** Twilio / Firebase Cloud Messaging

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-spoilage-detection.git
   cd food-spoilage-detection
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python backend
   npm install  # For frontend
   ```
3. **Run the backend server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📈 How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** IoT sensors and cameras capture food condition data.
2. **Processing & Analysis:** AI models analyze images, gas levels, and temperature to detect spoilage.
3. **Alert System:** Users receive real-time notifications if food quality deteriorates.
4. **Dashboard Monitoring:** Businesses can track food freshness and optimize inventory management.

## 🌍 Impact & Benefits
✅ **Reduces food waste** by detecting spoilage early.
✅ **Ensures food safety** for consumers.
✅ **Optimizes inventory management** for businesses.
✅ **Supports sustainability** by minimizing food wastage.
